<H2>Looking For Graduate Students</H2>

<P>
I am looking for new students in two areas: 
<A HREF="skin">Robot Skin</A>
and <A HREF="smart">Smarter Robots</A>.

<P>
Potential graduate students need to be admitted to a CMU graduate program
before I can take them on as students. Most of my students are in
<A HREF = "http://www.ri.cmu.edu/ri-education">Robotics
Institute graduate programs.</A> Please don't send me email asking if I will
accept you as a student. Admissions is handled by an admissions
committee, over which I have no influence. I can only consider
students who have already been admitted to a graduate program, and will
probably ignore your email.

<P>
My life goal is to fulfill the science fiction vision of machines that
achieve human levels of competence in perceiving, thinking, and acting.
A more narrow technical goal
is to understand how to get machines to generate and perceive human
behavior. I use two complementary approaches, exploring <b> humanoid
robotics </b> and <b> human aware environments. </b>  Building humanoid robots
tests our understanding of how to generate human-like behavior, and exposes
the gaps and failures in current approaches.
Building human aware environments (environments that perceive human activity
and estimate human internal state) pushes the development of machine
perception of humans.
In addition to being socially useful, building human aware environments
helps us develop humanoid robots that are capable of understanding and
interacting with humans.

<P>
Machine learning underlies much of my work in both humanoid
robotics and human aware environments.
I am an experimentalist in the field of robot learning, specializing
in the learning of challenging dynamic tasks such as juggling.
I combine designing learning algorithms with
exploring their behavior in implementations on actual robots and in
intelligent environments. My research interests include nonparametric
learning, memory-based learning,
reinforcement learning, learning from demonstration, and
modeling human behavior.

<H2>Biography</H2></A> 

<P>
I am a Professor in the
Robotics Institute and Human-Computer Interaction Institute at CMU.
I received the M.S. degree in Applied Mathematics
(Computer Science) from Harvard University and the Ph.D. degree in Brain
and Cognitive Science from M.I.T. 
I joined the M.I.T. faculty in 1986, 
moved to the Georgia Institute of Technology College of Computing in 1994,
and moved to CMU in 2000.
I have received an NSF Presidential Young Investigator Award, 
a Sloan Research Fellowship, and 
a Teaching Award from the MIT Graduate Student Council.
